Creating game servers directly from the game is no longer supported.\nThere are currently 3 ways of creating a SCP:SL server:\n- You can download SCP:SL dedicated server (Steam AppID: 996560) and run it on your computer\n- You can rent a VPS or a Dedicated Server from a hosting provider and run SCP:SL dedicated server there\n- You can rent a SCP:SL server from a game hosting provider that supports SCP:SL (eg. ZAP Hosting)\n\nClick the links below to get more info.\nYou can ask our tech support (link to our Discord server can be found in the main menu) for assistance.
